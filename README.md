# k8s-scenarios

New sub-title - Kubernetes demo scenarios to use in my trainings/webinars.

Only just realized that this was still referring to "Kubernetes demo scenarios for use with k1s (simple bash tool)", nice but since replaced by k1s.py and (WIP) kubeview-py.

- <a href="RollingUpdateScenario"> Rolling Update Scenario </a>: Builds upon the Rolling Update Scenario already present in k1s

Further scenarii not yet fully implemented, documented or scripted:
- Services
- Volumes
- IngressNginx
- Kustomize
- Scheduling
- WorkloadControllers
